                      Impactive, the organizing technology platform Jim
                      cofounded in 2017, was acquired by ActBlue, the leading
                      Democratic fundraising platform. The acquisition brings
                      together Impactive's suite of texting, phone banking,
                      relational organizing, and voter registration tools with
                      ActBlue's fundraising infrastructure, creating
                      comprehensive campaign technology for candidates and
                      causes at every level. Since its founding, Impactive has
                      powered over 2,000 candidates and NGOs. The combined
                      entity, now known as Impactive by ActBlue, will serve over
                      40,000 campaigns and NGOs, democratizing access to
                      professional-grade campaign tools regardless of budget or
                      team size. Jim is grateful to Impactive CEO Naseem
                      Makiya's dedicated vision and leadership. Jim's time at
                      Impactive strongly influenced his decision to enter public
                      service.

                      What began as a side project to create a
                      federally-compliant AI sandbox for 10x internal use in
                      June 2024 launched as a GSA agency-wide platform in March
                      2025. It has now launched as federal-wide shared AI
                      services platform at USAi.gov. This marked the
                      fastest-ever launch of a government-built digital shared
                      services platform. The open source platform offers
                      full-featured enterprise AI Chat, API and Evaluations
                      features with access to all flagship models from OpenAI,
                      Anthropic, Google, Meta and more at tokens-only pricing.
                      The platform‚Äôs launch was briefly delayed to allow OpenAI,
                      Anthropic and others to announce billion-dollar
                      concessions on their competing ‚Äúper-seat‚Äù platform
                      products.

                      Jim helped 10x turn an internal sandbox into a
                      federally-compliant, enterprise-ready fork of the popular,
                      fast-moving open source AI interface open-webui. The team
                      delivered stability and security improvements, a
                      gov-compliant CI/CD pipeline, as well as feature
                      improvements to enable rapid prototyping and validation of
                      government AI use cases by mixed teams of
                      program/policy/tech/compliance experts. The 10x is also
                      building out open source evaluations tooling for
                      continuous improvement and monitoring of guardrails and
                      model output quality to enable new AI products to meet
                      federal AI compliance standards. These tools will enable
                      the government to benefit fully from rapid advances in AI
                      product offerings without becoming ‚Äúlocked-in‚Äù to a small
                      number of vendors that prioritize government compliance.

                      US Notify, a federal government technology platform that
                      helps US agencies overcome privacy and compliance barriers
                      to communicating with the public via SMS and email, has
                      launched from TTS‚Äôs 10x accelerator. The platform is
                      designed to address government barriers to adoption of
                      commercial tools for critical comms channels, particularly
                      SMS. Over the course of four months, Jim led a engineering
                      team that took US Notify from an investment pitch to a
                      pilotable shared service prototype for the federal
                      government, facing 2+ million internal customers. Jim
                      served as lead engineer/manager, assembled the team, and
                      evaluated candidate open source technologies. Ultimately,
                      the excellent work done by the UK Government Digital
                      Service allowed the team to leap-frog into high-value,
                      real-world testing within weeks. Notify launched into open
                      beta in 2023 and is live at beta.notify.gov.

                      Impactive scored a big win. Our technology platform was
                      white-labeled as the Vote Joe app and was the centerpiece
                      of the Biden Campaign‚Äôs 50-state, $100,000,000+ digital
                      organizing campaign, providing mission-critical digital
                      services to millions of people for both the 2019 primary
                      and 2020 general campaigns. Our platform became especially
                      relevant during the unprecedented challenge of getting out
                      the vote during a pandemic. The Impactive-branded version
                      of our app and platform was used by wide-range of both
                      partisan and non-partisan NGOs, including Vote.org,
                      VoteAmerica, Planned Parenthood, and presidential primary
                      candidates, including vice-president, Kamala Harris.

                      During the midterm election cycle in 2018, as Head of
                      Product at Impactive, Jim was responsible for the
                      experimental design of a randomized controlled trial with
                      tens of thousands of participants testing the
                      effectiveness of the Impactive platform‚Äôs core premise of
                      voter mobilization via digital messages from friends and
                      acquaintances. Impactive later convened a team of data
                      scientists from Columbia University to co-author a
                      scientific paper based on the data collected. The strength
                      of results demonstrated in the paper led directly to
                      winning multiple bids for presidential campaign contracts
                      the following year.
